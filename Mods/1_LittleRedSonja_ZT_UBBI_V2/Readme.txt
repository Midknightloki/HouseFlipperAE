-- LittleRedSonja & ZTensity UBBI V2 -- 7 days to die V1 & V2 mod -- by LittleRedSonja --

Installation Instructions:

Extract the downloaded zip into your 7D2D Mods folder (create one if it does not exist).

To verify you have installed the mod correctly, the ModInfo.xml file should be located at Mods\LittleRedSonja_ZT_UBBI_V2\ModInfo.xml relative to your 7D2D install folder.


This mod IS NOT Server-Side-Only. Since it adds custom assets it requires installation both in server AND client for multiplayer. For solo player install like any other mod.

This mod can be used with both EAC ON or OFF.

This mod is compatible with V1 and V2 and later versions of the game. 


All credit for the original UBBI goes to Hernan and ZTensity. Thank you ZTensity for giving me permission to update and continue the work in UBBI.


I hope you enjoy the mod 💜. Let me know too if you have suggestions or find bugs.  🥰
